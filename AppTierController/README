This sample automation workflow implements a controller model that can start-up and shutdown applications by tier.

This solution can be used in an Azure Automation Account to start and stop applications that use virtual machines and virtual machine scale sets.
There are two tags that are used, one for setting a start tier value and the second to set a shutdown tier value.  The controllers will start VMs and VM scale sets in order from the lowest value to highest, starting at a value of zero.  The shutdown controller will shutdown resources from highest tier value to the lowest.

The default tag names are autoStart and autoShutdown but can be varied by passing in the name you want to use as a parameter.
